# Swap Drop Enroll

Swap Drop Enroll is a utility that helps UNC students get into classes. It uses sendgrid's webhook along with the Capybara webdriver to automatically enroll users into their classes. 

Since the first release, we have added numerous security features including a cipher from PyCrypto. There are two of us working on this, and each of us will know one of the two encryption keys to actually access user password. This way, no individual member of our team can ever access user passwords as a naked string. 

Scheduled to launch in Fall 2016.
